Clock Relationships
*******************

Clocks            |    rise  to  rise   |    fall  to  fall   |    rise  to  fall   |    fall  to  rise 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting  Ending  |  constraint  slack  |  constraint  slack  |  constraint  slack  |  constraint  slack
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================================================
 Note: 'No paths' indicates there are no paths in the design for that pair of clock edges.
       'Diff grp' indicates that paths exist but the starting clock and ending clock are in different clock groups.



Interface Information
